# Chatsemble Improvement Plan

This document outlines a draft plan for enhancing the Chatsemble project, focusing on key areas to improve its AI capabilities, administrative control, and overall utility.

## 1. Admin Dashboard

**Description:**
A comprehensive web interface for administrators to manage and configure various aspects of their Chatsemble organization. This includes managing users, configuring AI agents (personalities, tools, system prompts), defining organization-wide rules or policies, setting up permissions, and specifying paths for agent memory or knowledge bases.

**Potential Code Locations & Refactoring:**

*   **Frontend (New Development):**
    *   **Routes:** `src/client/routes/admin/` (new protected route group).
    *   **Components:** `src/client/components/admin/` for various dashboard sections (e.g., `UserManagement.tsx`, `AgentConfig.tsx`, `OrgSettings.tsx`).
    *   **State Management:** Leverage TanStack Query (already in use) for fetching and updating admin configurations. `src/client/lib/api-client.ts` would need new functions for admin API endpoints.
*   **Backend (New Endpoints & Logic):**
    *   **API Routes:** New Hono routes under `src/server/routes/protected/admin.ts` (or similar) to handle CRUD operations for admin settings.
    *   **Database Schemas:**
        *   **D1 (`src/server/db/schema/`):** May need new tables for global organization settings or admin-specific configurations if not already covered by extending existing tables (e.g., `organizations`).
        *   **Organization DO SQLite (`src/server/organization-do/db/schema.ts`):** Extend the `agents` table for more detailed configurations (e.g., specific system prompts, enabled tools, memory paths). Add tables for specific rules or permissions if granular control is needed within the DO.
    *   **Permissions Logic:** `src/server/auth/organization-permissions.ts` would need to be extended to define admin roles and check for these permissions in the new API endpoints.
*   **Agent Configuration:**
    *   Currently, agent personalities are mentioned (README Line 35). The dashboard would provide a UI to manage these, likely modifying data stored for agents in `src/server/organization-do/db/services/agents.ts` and its corresponding schema.

**Relevant Resources & Research:**

*   **UI Components:** Utilize Shadcn UI (already in project) for building a consistent and modern admin interface.
*   **Admin Dashboard Design:**
    *   Inspiration from other open-source admin panels (e.g., Strapi, Appwrite dashboards).
    *   Best practices for UX in admin interfaces.
*   **Configuration Management:** Consider patterns for storing and versioning configurations.

## 2. Persistent Memory & Knowledge Bases

**Description:**
Enable AI agents to retain information across multiple sessions and conversations within an organization. Integrate with vector databases (e.g., Cloudflare Vectorize) to allow agents to perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) over custom documents, past conversations, or other organizational knowledge. This would significantly enhance context-awareness (extending README Line 36).

**Potential Code Locations & Refactoring:**

*   **Agent Core Logic (`src/server/organization-do/agent.ts`):**
    *   Implement mechanisms for storing and retrieving conversational memory (e.g., summaries, key facts).
    *   Integrate RAG pipelines:
        *   Embedding generation for incoming data and queries.
        *   Vector search queries to retrieve relevant context.
        *   Augmenting LLM prompts with retrieved context.
*   **Organization Durable Object (`src/server/organization-do/organization.ts`):**
    *   Could act as an intermediary for accessing Cloudflare Vectorize or other vector stores.
    *   Manage ingestion pipelines for documents into the knowledge base.
*   **Database & Storage:**
    *   **Organization DO SQLite (`src/server/organization-do/db/schema.ts`):** Could store conversation summaries or pointers to vectorized data. Add tables for managing knowledge base sources.
    *   **Cloudflare Vectorize:** For storing and querying embeddings. Requires setup in `wrangler.jsonc` and SDK usage.
*   **AI Prompts (`src/server/ai/prompts/agent/`):**
    *   Modify `default-prompt.ts` and other relevant prompt files to include placeholders and instructions for using retrieved memory/knowledge.
*   **Tooling (`src/server/ai/tools/`):**
    *   Potentially a new internal "memory tool" or "knowledge base query tool" that agents can use.

**Relevant Resources & Research:**

*   **Cloudflare Vectorize:**
    *   Documentation: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)
    *   Wrangler configuration for Vectorize bindings.
*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**
    *   LangChain RAG documentation: [https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) (for concepts and patterns).
    *   LlamaIndex: [https://www.llamaindex.ai/](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) (another popular RAG framework).
    *   OpenAI Cookbook RAG: [https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/vector_databases](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/vector_databases)
*   **Memory Strategies for LLMs:** Short-term, long-term memory, summarization techniques.
*   **Vercel AI SDK:** Check for any built-in utilities for managing context or RAG.

## 3. Agent-to-Agent Collaboration

**Description:**
Implement a system allowing AI agents to delegate tasks to other specialized agents or work together on complex problems. This would transform agents from individual participants into a collaborative "ensemble" (enhancing README Line 34).

**Potential Code Locations & Refactoring:**

*   **Agent Core Logic (`src/server/organization-do/agent.ts`):**
    *   Introduce a communication protocol or message format for inter-agent requests and responses.
    *   Develop logic for task decomposition and delegation.
*   **Organization Durable Object (`src/server/organization-do/organization.ts`):**
    *   Could act as a central "router" or "coordinator" for inter-agent tasks.
    *   Manage a registry of available agents and their capabilities/specializations.
*   **Workflow Engine (Expanding on README Lines 40-43):**
    *   The existing workflow system could be extended to support steps that are assigned to specific agents or types of agents.
    *   `src/server/organization-do/workflow.ts` would need significant updates.
*   **Database (`src/server/organization-do/db/schema.ts`):**
    *   New tables might be needed for:
        *   A queue for inter-agent tasks.
        *   Shared state or context for collaborative tasks.
        *   Agent capability registration.

**Relevant Resources & Research:**

*   **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS):**
    *   Concepts: Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), Contract Net Protocol, Blackboard Systems.
    *   Academic papers on MAS architectures.
*   **Frameworks for Multi-Agent AI:**
    *   **Microsoft AutoGen:** [https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)
    *   **CrewAI:** [https://www.crewai.com/](https://www.crewai.com/)
    *   Study their approaches to agent roles, communication, and task management.
*   **Design Patterns for Distributed Systems:** Concepts like message queues, service discovery.

## 4. Proactive Assistance & Goal-Seeking

**Description:**
Enable agents to proactively offer suggestions, insights, or initiate tasks based on the ongoing conversation context, rather than only reacting to explicit mentions. Improve the "goal-oriented" nature of workflows (README Line 42) by allowing for more complex goal definitions and adaptive planning by agents.

**Potential Code Locations & Refactoring:**

*   **Agent Core Logic (`src/server/organization-do/agent.ts`):**
    *   Implement a mechanism for agents to "listen" to relevant conversations without being directly mentioned (requires careful permission and privacy considerations).
    *   Develop heuristics or LLM-driven logic for identifying opportunities for proactive assistance.
*   **AI Prompts (`src/server/ai/prompts/agent/`):**
    *   Design prompts that encourage proactive suggestions and sophisticated planning (e.g., using ReAct patterns).
    *   `src/server/ai/prompts/agent/workflow-prompt.ts` could be made more dynamic.
*   **Workflow Engine (`src/server/organization-do/workflow.ts`):**
    *   Allow workflows to have more abstract goals, with agents dynamically planning steps.
    *   Incorporate feedback loops for agents to adjust plans based on execution results.
*   **Real-time Message Handling (`src/server/organization-do/organization.ts`):**
    *   Might need to intelligently stream relevant parts of conversations to agents that have "proactive" capabilities enabled for a given chat room.
*   **Context Management:** This feature heavily relies on strong context understanding (see "Persistent Memory & Knowledge Bases").

**Relevant Resources & Research:**

*   **ReAct (Reason + Act) Prompting:**
    *   Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)
    *   Examples of ReAct implementation.
*   **AI Planning & Automated Reasoning:**
    *   Research in areas like Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN) or Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) for inspiration.
*   **Event-Driven Architectures:** For triggering proactive agent behaviors based on conversation events.
*   **Firebase Studio's "AI flows":** The concept of AI-driven flows might offer parallels.

## 5. Expanded and Customizable Tooling

**Description:**
Develop a more robust and extensible framework for adding new tools that AI agents can use. Integrate with a wider range of external services (e.g., project management like Jira/Trello, version control like GitHub, document stores like Google Drive/Notion) to allow agents to perform more complex actions directly within Chatsemble. This significantly builds upon existing tool usage (README Lines 37-39).

**Potential Code Locations & Refactoring:**

*   **Tool Definition & Registration (`src/server/ai/tools/`):**
    *   Create a more standardized interface or base class for tools (e.g., `Tool.ts`).
    *   Implement a dynamic tool registration mechanism, perhaps allowing tools to be enabled/disabled per agent or organization via the Admin Dashboard.
    *   `src/server/ai/tools/index.ts` would manage this registry.
*   **Agent Core Logic (`src/server/organization-do/agent.ts`):**
    *   Improve how agents discover and decide to use available tools based on the task and context. This involves better LLM prompting for function calling.
*   **Shared Types (`src/shared/types/`):**
    *   Define clear Zod schemas for tool inputs and outputs in `src/shared/types/agent.ts` or a new `tools.ts`.
*   **Configuration (`src/server/organization-do/db/schema.ts` & Admin Dashboard):**
    *   Store tool configurations (e.g., API keys for external services, specific parameters) securely, likely encrypted or managed as secrets.
    *   Allow admins to configure which tools are available to which agents.
*   **New Tool Implementations (in `src/server/ai/tools/`):**
    *   `github-tool.ts`, `jira-tool.ts`, `googledrive-tool.ts`, etc.
    *   Each tool would handle its own API authentication and interaction logic.

**Relevant Resources & Research:**

*   **LLM Function Calling / Tool Use:**
    *   OpenAI Function Calling: [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)
    *   Google Gemini Tool Use: [https://ai.google.dev/docs/function_calling](https://ai.google.dev/docs/function_calling)
    *   Vercel AI SDK documentation on tool usage.
*   **OpenAPI Specification (Swagger):** For a standardized way to define and interact with external APIs.
*   **API Client Libraries:** For interacting with specific services (e.g., Octokit for GitHub, official SDKs for Jira, Google APIs).
*   **Plugin Architectures:**
    *   Study how systems like ChatGPT Plugins or VS Code extensions manage and execute external functionalities.
*   **Secure Credential Management:**
    *   Cloudflare Secrets Store or environment variables for API keys.
    *   Patterns for securely passing credentials to tools.
