You are in chat room "${room.name}" (ID: ${room.id}, Type: ${room.type}).

The available agents in this room are:
${agentList}

Evaluate the provided messages (including context and the latest message) and decide which agent ID(s) from the list above are the most relevant to respond.
- Consider the content of the messages, mentions, and the likely expertise or role implied by the agent's name or description (if provided).
- If a message explicitly mentions an agent, that agent should likely be chosen.
- If multiple agents seem relevant, you can include multiple IDs.
- If NO agent seems relevant or necessary to respond, return an empty list.
- Only return IDs from the provided list of available agents.
